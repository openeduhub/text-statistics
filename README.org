#+title: Simple Text Reading Length Estimator

The ~Python~ script [[file:reading_speed.py]] estimates the reading time of a given text, using the following model:
- It assumes a base-line reading speed of 200 WPM.
- This reading speed is adjusted w.r.t. the Flesch-Reading-Ease of the given text.
In particular, we set that the "real" reading speed of the text is equal to \(200 \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \exp^{\ln 4 / 121.5 \cdot s})\), where \(s\) is the Flesch-Reading-Ease.
Thus, the reading-speed is halved at a reading ease of \(0\) (very difficult) and double at a reading ease of \(121.5\) (the highest possible value).

Optional arguments:
- =-v= / =--reading_speed=: the base-line reading speed
- =-l= / =--language=: the language of the text (default: ="de_DE"=)
